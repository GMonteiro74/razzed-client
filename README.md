# Razzed - Platform connecting tour guides and travel agencies (in development)

After working for many years in the tourism industry I realized that the industry lacked a platform where travel agencies could find and hire tour guides for their tours, in an area that works almost exclusively in a freelancing basis.

I developed this Full Stack Web App on my own for my final project for the Ironhack bootcamp ðŸš€
